## Prerequisites

No installation required -- works directly in any modern web browser.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishabkumar03/nz
   ```
   
2. Place all images files (`nz.jpg`, `currency.jpg`, `national emblem.jpeg`, etc.) in the same folder as the HTML file.

3. Open the project in your browser:
   ```diff
   index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Explore the **national symbols** by clicking on the Coat of Arms, currency, or map -- each redirects to detailed pages.
3. Read though the fun facts section for cultural insights.
4. Browse the tourist places generally -- each image links directly to its Google Maps location.
5. Scroll down to the footer to contact the creator for your own personalized "Hometown" webpage.

  - Modify the facts under the `<ul>` section in `index.html`.
  - Add or remove destinations in the tourist section.
 
## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing

- Avoid spaces or capitalization mismatches in file names.

### Layout or Font Issues

- Check Google Fonts import links are correct.

## Security Considerations
